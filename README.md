🛡️ Sentinoid (Sentinel Edge)The Hardware-Bound, Air-Gapped Mobile Security Fortress📜 1. The Sentinoid ManifestoIn an age of AI-driven swarm attacks and silent telemetry, we believe that if code can touch the internet, it can be compromised. Sentinoid is an uncompromising security framework designed for absolute isolation. It operates on a Strict Zero-Internet Policy. Sentinoid does not "backup" your data to a cloud—it anchors it to your device's physical silicon. By binding encryption directly to hardware-locked biometrics, we ensure that your data exists only when you are physically present.🚀 2. Core Security Pillars (Prime Features)🛡️ Biometric-Bound Cryptographic ShroudSentinoid abandons the "central vault" model.Distributed Encryption: We deploy an AES-256-GCM shroud around sensitive third-party apps (Banking, Gallery, Notes).Cryptographic Binding: Decryption keys are generated in the TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) and are physically "unsealed" only via a successful biometric scan.Zero-Password Policy: No PINs, no passwords, no shoulder-surfing. No Biometrics = No Key = No Data.🔌 Connectivity Shield (Absolute Air-Gap)Hardened Manifest: The Sentinoid binary contains zero network permissions. It is physically unable to communicate with any server.Handshake Hardening: Actively monitors and terminates unauthorized background Bluetooth, NFC, or Wi-Fi Direct requests.🛑 Feature Permission Manager (FPM)Kernel-Level Proxy: Intercepts hardware calls to the Mic, Camera, and GPS.Mock-Stream Injection: Instead of blocking a request (which alerts the malware), FPM feeds it Null Data or Static Mock Streams, neutralizing background spying while keeping the OS stable.⚡ 3. Advanced Tactical Defense🍯 The Honeypot TrapDeception Strategy: Generates realistic "Ghost Data" (fake banking logs and sensitive images) to act as bait for automated scrapers.Silent Alarm: Any read/write interaction with these files triggers a Total Lockdown, freezing the real encryption layer and logging the intruder's hardware ID locally.🐕 Hardware Watchdog & Anti-TamperIntegrity Monitoring: Constant real-time checks for Rooting, Bootloader unlocking, or USB Debugging.Self-Destruct Protocol: If a new biometric (fingerprint/face) is added to the system settings, Sentinoid immediately purges all local keys. This prevents "forced entry" via secondary biometric registration.👾 Local Heuristic Malware EngineBehavioral Analysis: Identifies "Screen Scraping" and "Overlay Attacks" (common in UPI fraud) using local heuristics without needing cloud signature databases.Battery Optimized: Uses Asynchronous Monitoring to maintain <1% battery impact on modern (2026) mobile chipsets.🛡️ 4. Automated Attack MitigationSwarm Defense: Detects high-velocity, coordinated access attempts from distributed botnets.Exponential Backoff: Every failed biometric match doubles the hardware's response latency. 10 failed attempts can result in years of lockout delay.🛠️ 5.

LicenseSentinoid is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0).We chose this license to ensure that the security community can always verify the "No Backdoor" promise. Any derivative works must also be open-source, preventing the commercialization of hidden exploits within our framework.🔍 7. Verification Guide (For Security Auditors)To verify Sentinoid's claims, please audit the following files in the repository:AndroidManifest.xml: Confirm the absence of android.permission.INTERNET.SecurityModule.cpp: Inspect the Biometric Key Derivation logic.WatchdogService.java: Verify the Anti-Tamper / Key Purge triggers.🛠️ 8. Installation & SetupPre-requisite: Sentinoid requires Device Administrator and Accessibility Services to perform hardware-level interception.Build: Compile using the provided Makefile for your specific architecture.Initialization: Set your "Golden Biometric" signature.Shroud Deployment: Use the UI to select apps for encryption wrapping.Sentinoid: Secure by Design. Isolated by Choice.
